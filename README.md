# UserAuth
Using a tutorial by WebDevSimplified, I created this simple user authentication system. Frontend was taken from Creative Tim

It runs on port 3000, use "npm run devStart" to start the server. You can then find it in http://localhost:3000/
Make sure to replace the mongodb atlas credentials in the functions.js file with your own.
